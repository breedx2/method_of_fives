# Method of Fives

An A/V work derived from a chance occurrence.

# Artist Statement

Here in the future, a staggering overabundance of media/data leads us to develop a form of technological molybdomancy.  Experience is now forever shaped by memetic constructs never materialized in a physical world.
The working mind is deeply susceptible to pareidolia, and this phenomenon is purposefully exploited with abstract storytelling.

# Technical details

Source video frames are generated by ffmpeg and piped into `framer.py`.  This code slices the frames into 5 rows and 5 columns and does a brightness averaging that is ultimately output into raw per-frame row/col output files.  The `method_of_fives.pd` patch uses these row/col files to fill arrays that drive composition parameters.
