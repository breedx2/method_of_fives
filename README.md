# Technical details

Source video frames are generated by ffmpeg and piped into `framer.py`.  This code slices the frames into 5 rows and 5 columns and does a brightness averaging that is ultimately output into raw per-frame row/col output files.  The `method_of_fives.pd` patch uses these row/col files to fill arrays that drive composition parameters.
